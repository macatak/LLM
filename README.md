LLM and AI type code

These are all works in progress.

  - ollama - How to setup Ollama on an Linux system  

  - Hugging Face - Based on the learning paths on the site : https://huggingface.co/learn  
    - There is some customization, mainly playing with the arguments in the call.  
    - NOTE :  Current pipeline code is for a system with a GPU. For systems without one remove:
      
          ```text
          device=0
          ```
