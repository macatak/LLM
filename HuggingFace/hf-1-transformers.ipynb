    "    - Example Use Case: Analyzing customer reviews to gauge overall satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summarization\n",
    "    - Explanation: Summarizes long pieces of text into shorter, concise versions.\n",
    "    - Example Use Case: Summarizing lengthy articles or reports to provide quick overviews.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Translation\n",
    "    - Explanation: Translates text from one language to another.\n",
    "    - Example Use Case: Translating user queries in multiple languages for a multilingual chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Zero-Shot Classification\n",
    "    - Explanation: Classifies text into categories without any prior training on those specific categories.\n",
